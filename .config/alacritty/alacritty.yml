  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for

  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons

  #
  # Values for `startup_mode`:

#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
